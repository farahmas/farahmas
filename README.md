### 🎮 Tank Battle Card Game – Java OOP Project  
**Programlama Laboratuvarı I – Project II (2024)**  
Designed and developed a two-player tank battle card game using Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
- Players (user vs. computer) take turns drawing random battle vehicle cards from a shuffled deck.  
- Cards belong to one of three types: **Land**, **Sea**, or **Air**, each inheriting from a base `Card` class.  
- Each card has attributes such as `name`, `damage`, and `level`.  
- Battle logic is based on **type advantages** (e.g., Air > Land, Land > Sea, Sea > Air), as well as comparing damage and level values.  
- Applied OOP concepts:  
  - **Inheritance** for vehicle types  
  - **Polymorphism** for card comparison logic  
  - **Encapsulation** for managing card data  
- Game flow includes card selection, comparison, and point calculation.

- Two factions: **Human Empire** vs. **Orc Legion**, each with units, heroes, monsters, and research upgrades.  
- Parsed 5 JSON files (`unit_types`, `heroes`, `creatures`, `research`, and scenario) manually using string manipulation and `struct`s.  
- Downloaded remote scenario files using **libcurl** and stored them locally.  
- Combat mechanics involved:  
  - Initial stats and effects from heroes, monsters, and research  
  - Calculations for critical hits, fatigue (every 5 rounds), and net damage  
  - Health updates and win condition check after each round  
- Simulated turns with alternating attacks (Humans on odd rounds, Orcs on even).  
- Wrote all battle steps and results to `savas_sim.txt`.  
- Developed 2D visual representation using **raylib**:  
  - 10x10 battlefield grid with PNG assets for units, monsters, and background  
  - Health bars and survivor status shown at end of battle

  - **Manual JSON parsing**, `struct` arrays  
  - **File I/O**, dynamic memory, simulation loop  
  - **Graphics programming** with sprite rendering  

This project demonstrates strong skills in low-level programming, data parsing, game logic, and third-party C library integration.
