- Computed optimal routes based on three filters:  
  - **Shortest Distance**  
  - **Fastest Duration**  
  - **Minimum Transfer**  
- Utilized **custom graph traversal algorithms** (modified BFS/Dijkstra) to account for:  
  - Different vehicle types (bus, tram, taxi)  
  - Transfer penalties and costs  
  - Real-world distance and fare calculations from JSON files  
- Integrated two types of visual feedback:  
  - **Google Maps API** via WebView for real location mapping  
  - **JGraphX** for route visualization as a transport graph  
- Applied **SOLID principles** and implemented **Factory**, **Strategy**, and **Template Method** design patterns  
- Supported user discounts based on passenger type (student, teacher, senior)  
- Output included: route steps, vehicle icons, cost/time breakdown, and special conditions  
- Fully modular and extensible architecture suitable for future city expansions

### 🧪 Electronics & Embedded Systems – Arduino Projects  
**Programlama Laboratuvarı II – Project I (2025)**  
Designed and built an **IoT-based Smart Vehicle Safety and Control System** using **Arduino Mega**, simulated in **Proteus**.  
- Inputs:  
  - **Seatbelt button** – prevents engine start unless buckled  
  - **Door switch** – detects if door is open or closed  
  - **LDR (Light Sensor)** – detects ambient light for auto headlight control  
  - **LM35 (Temperature Sensor)** – monitors in-vehicle temperature  
  - **Potentiometer** – simulates fuel level readings  
- Outputs:  
  - **RGB LED** – indicates door status (e.g., pink when open)  
  - **Buzzer** – alerts for unsafe conditions  
  - **DC Motor** – represents engine, activated only under safe conditions  
  - **16x2 LCD Display** – real-time status messages  
  - **Standard LEDs** – visual indicators for fuel and lights  
- Implemented logic flow with `if-else` control structures and flags for motor status  
- Displayed dynamic data (temperature, fuel level, status) using the LCD  
- All modules simulated in **Proteus**, ensuring correct logic, wiring, and timing  
- Emphasized **real-world embedded systems principles**, including safety checks, modular code, and simulation accuracy

### 🧠 Academic Author Collaboration Graph – Python & PyQt5  
**Programlama Laboratuvarı I – Project I (2024)**  
Developed an interactive graph-based desktop application that visualizes academic co-authorship data using `.xlsx` datasets.  
- Parsed Excel data to extract author names, ORCID IDs, paper titles, and co-author relationships using **Pandas**.  
- Manually constructed a **weighted undirected graph**, where:  
  - **Nodes** represent authors  
  - **Edges** represent co-authorships  
  - **Edge weights** indicate the number of joint papers  
- Implemented a custom `Graph` class with features like:  
  - `find_all_paths` and `find_shortest_path` between authors  
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)** generation from shortest paths  
  - Functions to compute most collaborative author, total collaborations, and longest path  
- Designed a rich GUI using **PyQt5**:  
  - Clickable graph nodes that display author and paper info  
  - Zoom-in/out functionality via mouse wheel  
  - Interactive sidebar with 7 different analytical tools  
  - Visual feedback on selected paths and results  
- Applied core computer science concepts: **graph theory**, **recursion**, **tree structures**, and **data parsing**.

### 🎮 Tank Battle Card Game – Java OOP Project  
**Programlama Laboratuvarı I – Project II (2024)**  
Designed and developed a two-player tank battle card game using Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
- Players (user vs. computer) take turns drawing random battle vehicle cards from a shuffled deck.  
- Cards belong to one of three types: **Land**, **Sea**, or **Air**, each inheriting from a base `Card` class.  
- Each card has attributes such as `name`, `damage`, and `level`.  
- Battle logic is based on **type advantages** (e.g., Air > Land, Land > Sea, Sea > Air), as well as comparing damage and level values.  
- Applied OOP concepts:  
  - **Inheritance** for vehicle types  
  - **Polymorphism** for card comparison logic  
  - **Encapsulation** for managing card data  
- Game flow includes card selection, comparison, and point calculation.  
- Clear win/lose result shown after five rounds.  
- Emphasized clean code structure, modular design, and game logic abstraction.

### ⚔️ Battle Simulation Game – C Programming & JSON Parsing  
**Programlama Laboratuvarı I – Project I (2023)**  
Created a turn-based fantasy battle simulator in **C**, featuring data-driven combat between two factions using **JSON files**, **custom logic**, and **graphical visualization**.  

- Two factions: **Human Empire** vs. **Orc Legion**, each with units, heroes, monsters, and research upgrades.  
- Parsed 5 JSON files (`unit_types`, `heroes`, `creatures`, `research`, and scenario) manually using string manipulation and `struct`s.  
- Downloaded remote scenario files using **libcurl** and stored them locally.  
- Combat mechanics involved:  
  - Initial stats and effects from heroes, monsters, and research  
  - Calculations for critical hits, fatigue (every 5 rounds), and net damage  
  - Health updates and win condition check after each round  
- Simulated turns with alternating attacks (Humans on odd rounds, Orcs on even).  
- Wrote all battle steps and results to `savas_sim.txt`.  
- Developed 2D visual representation using **raylib**:  
  - 10x10 battlefield grid with PNG assets for units, monsters, and background  
  - Health bars and survivor status shown at end of battle  
- Key programming concepts used:  
  - **Manual JSON parsing**, `struct` arrays  
  - **File I/O**, dynamic memory, simulation loop  
  - **Graphics programming** with sprite rendering  

This project demonstrates strong skills in low-level programming, data parsing, game logic, and third-party C library integration.
